# ‚òï CoffeeNTea üçµ

This repository was created for me and my awesome group to develop our final project for the college course "Operating System Kernel Implementation."
In this project, our goal is to build two Linux kernel modules: **Kfetch** (in Portuguese, the pronunciation of ‚ÄúKfetch‚Äù sounds like the word for ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù) and **Tea** (because it's just cool):

1. ‚òï**Kfetch:** A module that implements a writable/readable **character device** at /dev/kfetch.
When read, it fetches and returns useful system information.
When written to, it selects which information will be fetched.

2. üçµ**Tea**: A module that implements a **procfs** file that displays useful statistics of the processes running on the system.
It asserts a score of how "dangerous" or abnormal is a process behaviour, and use it to classify that process risk as "high", "medium" and "low".

Each of the modules has it's own directory with the source code and more detailed information.
